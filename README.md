Please fill out this survey:

https://lehmanclass.typeform.com/to/I0BUGj

Next, mark your self as having attending by using `curl`.

Send a http POST to 157.245.10.53 with a JSON body identifying you:

{
	"email": "$YOUR_LEHMAN_EMAIL_GOES_HERE"
}

HINT: you'll need to send a header with 'Content-Type: application/json'

Does this sound like greek to you? Time to use your googling skills. Google "send http request with curl" to get started, and vary up your google search query to 
find out more.

If you've tried a few times and are still stuck, you can email me.
